# DiabPredict

The goal of DiabPredict is to provide a reliable and efficient way to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and identify patterns that could indicate the presence of diabetes. The models are trained using a dataset containing various health metrics, and the project includes a feature engineering pipeline to enhance the predictive power of the models.

the project is broken into the following pipelines:
- [Backfill pipeline](#backfill-pipeline)
- [Replinshment pipeline](#replinshment-pipeline)
- [Model training pipeline](#model-training-pipeline)
- [Feature pipeline](#feature-pipeline)
- [Batch prediction pipeline](#batch-prediction-pipeline)


Backfill Feature Pipeline: Initially fill the feature group with historical data.
Regular Update Pipeline: Regularly update the feature group with new data.
Training Pipeline: Train the model using the prepared data.
Prediction Pipeline: Use the model to make predictions on new data.
Detailed instructions for each pipeline can be found in the project documentation.
